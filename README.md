# Landing-Page
First of All, this is the project for the first 2 weeks in the professional Nano degree for **egfwd and idita and udacity**. Briefly, it's all about a landing- page and I added for it some features as smooth scroll and adding a background animation for the active section also I added that the navigation bar will be done dynamically as you remove or add sections.
